From an issue
When viewing an issue, you can create an associated branch directly from that page. Branches created this way use the default pattern for branch names from issues, including variables.

Prerequisites:

You must have at least the Developer role for the project.
To create a branch from an issue:

On the left sidebar, select Search or go to and find your project.
Select Plan > Issues and find your issue.
Below the issue description, find the Create merge request dropdown list, and select  to display the dropdown list.
Select Create branch. A default Branch name is provided, based on the default pattern for this project. If desired, enter a different Branch name.
Select Create branch to create the branch based on your projectâ€™s default branch.
